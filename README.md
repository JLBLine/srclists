 - Added the most up to date and complete PUMA srclist,
   srclist_puma-v2_complete.txt. This srclist covers the
   full southern sky, using either mwacs or mrc as a base.
   It is complete with point source extended models between
   22h < RA < 6h, -57deg < Dec < +3deg (2 hours about EoR0
   and EoR1). Elsewhere, only the sources accepted by PUMA
   are currently included.
   
 - In ./puma_v2, the separate srclists used to create
   srclist_puma-v2_complete.txt are stored and explained
   
 - In ./extended, information and plots of all the extended
   sources in srclist_puma-v2_complete.txt are included
